## 🧪 Data Engineering Experiments

Beyond the structured projects, I've also built small tools and conducted tests around:

- Custom search engines
- File ingestion and preprocessing
- Streamlit data tools
- JSON/YAML-driven workflow orchestration

These aren’t always flashy, but they showcase the hands-on problem-solving mindset crucial in data engineering.
