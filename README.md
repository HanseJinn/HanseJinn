### 💬 Connex – Real-Time Communication Platform

**A fullstack messaging app inspired by platforms like Discord—designed for seamless real-time communication.**

- Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **WebSockets** for live chat  
- **React** frontend styled with **TailwindCSS** and **Shadcn**  
- Features include user authentication, channels, and message history  
- Real-time updates via **Socket.IO** for instant messaging  
- Scalable backend architecture with **Docker** and **REST APIs**

**Why it matters for Data Engineering:**

- Showcases skills in **real-time data handling** and **event-driven architecture**  
- Lays the foundation for implementing **message logging**, **analytics**, or **data streaming**  
- Demonstrates **fullstack development**, crucial for understanding end-to-end data flow

## 🧪 Data Engineering Experiments

Beyond the structured projects, I've also built small tools and conducted tests around:

- Custom search engines
- File ingestion and preprocessing
- Streamlit data tools
- JSON/YAML-driven workflow orchestration

These aren’t always flashy, but they showcase the hands-on problem-solving mindset crucial in data engineering.
